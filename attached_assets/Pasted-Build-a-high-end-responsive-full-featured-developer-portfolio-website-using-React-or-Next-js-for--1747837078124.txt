Build a high-end, responsive, full-featured developer portfolio website using React (or Next.js for smoother routing), Tailwind CSS (or SCSS), and Framer Motion/GSAP for buttery smooth transitions. Design should follow a synergized, immaculate aesthetic with soft shadows, gradients, minimalistic typography, and full responsiveness for all screen sizes.

üìå Main Features:
Landing Page: Large hero section with smooth animation, dynamic greeting text, and placeholder to upload user's own profile picture.

Smooth Navigation: Use animated, non-jarring transitions between pages (no full page reloads), including scrolling and link navigation.

Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Provide a working toggle. Ensure that the theme switches correctly (currently stuck in one mode ‚Äî needs fixing).

About Me: Full page explaining skills, tools, journey, experience, and timeline UI for achievements.

Projects Page:

Include sample project cards with image, name, tech stack, GitHub/demo buttons.

Create an additional ‚ÄúMore Projects‚Äù page or modal (separate route preferred) with extended project list (supporting future scalability).

Testimonials Page: Include sample testimonials from clients/friends with name, image, role, and review.

Contact Page: Contact form with name/email/message and space for address, Google Maps iframe (optional), and social links.

Resume Section: Add a downloadable CV button (PDF) that opens/downloads the user's file.

Social Media Section: Fully linked with icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Instagram, etc.).

Blog or "Spaces" Page: Optional ‚Äî a page to share ideas, writings, or updates, sorted by date.

GitHub Integration: Show live GitHub repository stats or contributions via GitHub Graph or pinned repo cards.

Replaceable Assets: Use placeholder images and content to be easily editable by the user later.

üõ† Tools & Fixes Required (Important):
Navbar/Header Bug:

The top navbar is currently too large or blurry, and overlaps the tagline text and name.

Adjust height or padding/margin so the user‚Äôs full name and tagline are fully visible on load.

Dark/Light Mode Toggle Issue:

The toggle is stuck on one mode (either light or dark).

Ensure the toggle can successfully switch themes and that the theme is preserved when navigating between pages.

Missing Extended Project Showcase:

Add a separate page or section to view more detailed projects, with expandable cards or filters.

This should allow future scalability to add 10+ projects, each with images, tech tags, GitHub/demo links.

Smooth Page Transitions:

Ensure routing between pages is fluid, no abrupt loading (use Framer Motion/GSAP/Page Transitions).

Header Optimization:

The blurriness and size of the header bar should be toned down.

Make sure it‚Äôs elegant but not intrusive.

Theme Defaults + State Preservation:

Remember user preference (light/dark) using localStorage or Context to prevent theme reset.

üí° Bonus Enhancements (Optional but Recommended):
Add loading animations or interactive micro-UX effects (hover effects, parallax scroll, etc.).

Include "Skills Radar" or interactive chart for showcasing tool proficiency.

Use animated SVGs or Lottie animations where appropriate.

Add a newsletter subscription field (optional).

Use clean, scalable, modular code. Organize components well (e.g., /components, /pages, /assets). Prioritize user control, clarity, and aesthetic balance in every part of the UI/UX. Make sure all placeholder content can easily be edited by the user (images, text, links).
